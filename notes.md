- A GitHub fork creates a copy of a repository on GitHub. It's typically used to experiment with or contribute to open source projects. While forking copies the repo to GitHub, you can then download it to your local development environment. Forks stay linked to the original repository, making it easy to get updates and merge them. You can also use a fork to suggest changes to the original project by creating a pull request.
